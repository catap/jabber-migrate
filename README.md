Jabber Roster Migration
=======================

This tool simplifies migrating of a roster (contact list in XMPP terminology) from one Jabber server (including GTalk!) to another.


How to get it
-------------

You can download an archive with compiled code, all JAR dependencies and `roster-migrate` script from the [releases page](https://github.com/catap/jabber-migrate/releases/), or build it yourself using Maven.

The only runtime requirement is Java 1.8+.
If you want to use `roster-migrate` shell script, then youâ€™ll also need some POSIX-compatible shell.

Roster import:

 or put it as first line inside `export.txt` and yous `... import < export.txt`

--------------------

The exported format contains one line for every contact.

Format:

    <isRemove>;<nickname>;<user>;[<groups>]

* isRemove ... `-` to remove contact, `+` to add contact
* nickname ... contact nickname
* user     ... contact ID
* groups   ... comma-separated list of groups

Examples:

    +;Sam;somebody@jabber.cz;[Friends]
    -;alien;123@icq;[]
    +;alien;123@icq.netlab.cz;[Sales,Travel]

Import from Adium
-----------------

If you would like to import your old contacts from adium to new jabber server, you can use this tools by

    $ ./bin/roster-migrate --jid test@jabber.org -w import --adium -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adium\ 2.0/Users/Default/Contact\ List.plist

Cleanup roster
--------------

For last time a lot of services shutdown their s2s (for example gmail, ya.ru and many on them).
This tools also provide an easy way to create a list of users that may be removed because they are unreachable.

    $ ./bin/roster-migrate --jid test@jabber.org -w export --onlyUnreachable -f export.txt

Unreachable domain means:
 - hasn't got any reachable address (over SRV records or direct connect to 5269)
 - your servers returned error that remote-server-not-found

Unreachable JID means:
 - your server's returned error that recipient-unavailable
 - domain is reachable and script can register JID on it
